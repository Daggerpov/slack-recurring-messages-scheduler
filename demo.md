# Demo

This is a command line interface to schedule send  
(recurring - normally impossible) messages in Slack

- [] README -> installation & setup done
- [] Delete existing schedule sent messages to start clean
- [] `./slack-scheduler help` -> show args
- [] send a quick test command to channel
- [] schedule a more complex (recurring) one
- [] list & delete commands usage due to Slack's limitations

As you can see, they're grouped by how I scheduled them. 

The `list` and `delete` commands are the only way to interface with these  scheduled messages, since they won't appear on the Slack-native UI.
